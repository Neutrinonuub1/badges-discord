# 🏆 Discord Badges 🏆

A **complete visual catalog** of every known badge in Discord — from user and bot badges to server-related and event-exclusive ones.  

Badges in Discord serve as visual achievements, identifying contributions, participation, or status. Some are still obtainable, while others have become historical relics.  
This repository aims to **document them all** accurately.
